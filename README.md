Exam:
Create a new repository on your Github and name it `The-Good-Travel`.
​
Build a one-page website using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. The wire-frame of the targeted page is attached to Slack.
​
You will be building a simple webpage `The Good Travel` which contains all of the `Places` that you will travel to.
​
- As a user, I would like to be able to add new `Places` so I can track the `Places` I have in my page.
​
  - Create a form in order to add the **Places name** and **Trip Place** and **Type Of Transport**.
  - The Trip Place should have a predefined list that contains the following:
    - HAWAII
    - LONDON
    - PARIS
    - ITALY
    - SLOVAKIA
    - MALAYSIA
​
- As a user, I would like to view all of my Places that I already added so that I can quickly view my Places in my page. - Whenever you add a place to travel using the form, you should use the local storage in order to get all the Places from it and render them using DOM.
​
- As a user, I would like to see along side the place information, the Places image. The place images can be found in the folder directory img.
​
**Stretch Goals**
​
- As a user, I would like to delete any chosen place so I can handle the Places in my page. - When you press on the 'X' button, the place should be deleted from the rendered DOM and the local storage.
​
- As I user, I would like to have the option to clear the whole rendered DOM. There will be a button when clicked it will clear the local Storage and the rendered DOM.
